<h2>This is my first html/css project!</h2>
<p>First, I need to find out what an md file is. (a little googling later) Ah, markdown syntax file. <strong>Note:</strong>Stackoverflow dot com is my friend!</p>
<p>Before I do any more, gonna try that whole git commit thing.</p>
<p>YAY!</p>
<p>Aright,anyway. This project has 2 goals:
<ol>
    <li> Practice using html, css, and github <strong> AND</strong>
    <li> Remake the Google homepage from scratch to impress my boyfriend and cats
</ol>
